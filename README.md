# ChronoState
**A coroutine-aware, asynchronous-first state machine module for Roblox!**

### Overview

**ChronoState** is a lightweight, coroutine-safe state machine for Roblox written in **Luau**. Designed for systems like weapons, character states, or UI flows, it ensures that:

- Each **state transition is awaited** before continuing.
- States are structured as `Enter` and `Exit` functions.
- Coroutine yielding and cancellation are safely handled.
- Cleanup and resource management are built-in.

### Requirements:

The module uses two external modules: Promise and Janitor.
 - [Janitor: https://github.com/howmanysmall/Janitor](https://github.com/howmanysmall/Janitor).
 - [Promise: https://github.com/evaera/roblox-lua-promise](https://github.com/evaera/roblox-lua-promise)

Be sure to include them in your project and **change the require path** in the ChronoState module if needed!

### Purpose

ChronoState is a simple, extensible state machine that you can customize for your specific use cases. It's especially useful for gameplay systems that require:

- Clean transitions
- Awaitable logic
- Resource lifecycle management

### Contributing

I plan to continue upgrading ChronoState into a more advanced, general-purpose solution.  
**Iâ€™d love to hear your ideas, feedback, or contributions!** Feel free to open an issue or pull request.
